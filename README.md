### District Summary (Removed Data)

How is the district summary affected?
The two results demostrate a few ideas of what taking THS 9th grade data does to the district as a whole.
Overall, what occurred here is:
*The average math score decreased from 79.0 to 78.9.
*The average reading score show no diffrence.
*The passing math percentage decreased from 75.0% to 74.8%
*The overall passing rate decreased from 65.2% to 64.9%.
As a district, the removal of the THS's 9th grade data shows a very minimal amout of change. The most effected part of the district summary would be the overall passing rate with as decrease of 0.3%. This is most likely due to the fact that a single from from one school is a small part of the a rather large data set.

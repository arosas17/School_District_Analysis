# School_District_Analysis
Thomas High School(THS)


## Overview of the school district analysis

To demostrate what will happen in placing null data into a data set.

Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results

Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.




### District Summary (Complete Data)

### District Summary (Removed Data)

As a district, the removal of THS's 9th grade data shows a very minimal amount of change. The most effected part of the district summary would be the overall passing rate with as decrease of 0.3%. This is most likely due to the fact that a single from one school is a small part of a rather large data set.  The two tables demostrate a few ideas of what taking THS 9th grade data does to the district as a whole. This would indicate that the THS 9th grade students were generally doing well, grade-wise, and bringing the results up slightly in the disctrict summary.

Overall, the changes when the data was taken out are:
* The average math score decreased from 79.0 to 78.9.
* The average reading score show no diffrence.
* The passing math percentage decreased from 75.0% to 74.8%
* The passing reading percentage decreased from 85.8% to 85.7%
* The overall passing rate decreased from 65.2% to 64.9%.

How is the school summary affected?

Natutally, since the school summary table is devided into schools, THS was the only school effected by the removal of their grades. With this removal of data, a general decrease in passing percentage is shown. The average reading score stayed roughly the same. Overall, only small changes were made to THS data with the removal of their 9th grade information. This would indicate that the 9th grade scores of THS should be very similar to the THS scores as a whole.  

When the data was taken out, it led to changes in THS, such as:

* A small decrease in average math score from 83.42 to 83.35.
* A small increase in average reading score from 83.85 to 83.90
* A small decrease in percentage passing math from 93.27% to 93.19%
* A small decrease in percentage passing reading from 97.31% to 97.02%
* A small decrease in percentage passing overall from 90.95% to 90.63%

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

The tables above show the top five schools in the district based on the overall passing percentage. Although the overall percentage of THS decreased to 90.63%, the school still in 2nd place as it did prior to dismissing the 9th grade data. However, it is noted that it nearly dropped to 3rd placed by Griffin High School, who had an overall passing percentage of 90.60%. This would be a difference of approximately 0.03% before THS is dropped a place.
